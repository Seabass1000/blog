_Hayden Quilty_ is a Senior Data Analyst at Root where he identifies high value underwriting opportunities and ensures they are delivered at a FinTech startup company. Hayden is currently pursuing new opportunities in product management and analytics. He graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Biochemistry from Virginia Tech in 2021. Upon graduating, he recognized that he was more driven by the data and the technology behind biochemistry than the process of doing the science itself. He spent the following months learning SQL, data analysis, and machine learning skills and landed a job as a machine learning model developer within the auto insurance space later that summer.
