This blog shows off some of my recent projects across my different interests. My hope is that these articles are interesting and provide some insight on new data and techniques for use in everyday life. This website was built with GitHub Pages, the repo is found [here](https://github.com/jhquilty99/blog). This website was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/about/) with the [Ananke theme](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke).
